/* waks:start=Configuring a Facebook auth server=start
First, you need to register your application with Facebook.

1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/apps, and click "Register Now" to become a Facebook developer
2. Name your app and give a contact email
3. Go to "Facebook Login" > "Settings"
4. Make sure "Client OAuth Login," "Web OAuth Login," "Enforce HTTPS," and "Use Strict Mode for Redirect URIs" are enabled
5. Add the full URL for your `/redirect` route (eg. `https://web-app-kitchen-sink-api.herokuapp.com/apis/social-auth/redirect`)
6. Go to "Settings" > "Basic", and save your App ID and App Secret in your environment variables. Optionally, update the app icon, URL, TOS, and privacy policy (required for public deployment).
7. Go to "Settings" > "Advanced", and activate "Require App Secret"

There are two major things to configure on the server:

1. The Facebook strategy, which will get a user's Facebook credentials so we can encode them into a JWT
2. The JWT strategy, which will decode the JWT they send and make sure they're allowed to access the data they're requesting.

/* waks:start=Logging in=start
"Logging in" to a stateless service like this just means generating a token and sending it to the client to send on future API calls. `/login` will send the user to Facebook to log in, then it will redirect them to our `/redirect` endpoint with their Facebook data. `/redirect` generates another web page that encodes that data into a JWT to send back to the original app that called `/login`.

// prompting them to log in if they are not

// (which you need to register with them), which generates a page
